## Binary Random Number Generator Tests (RNGbin-tests)

Simple, self-contained randomness tests for a binary numbers sequence. Tests are designed for educational purposes.

| Test | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| matrix_visualization(rnd_seq)  | Visualize a random string as a matrix. No  patterns should be visible. | ![matrix visualization](img/matrix_visualization.png) |
| random_walk(rnd_seq)  | A random walk is the walk on the integer number line which starts at 0, and at each step moves -1 for bit 0 or +1 for bit 1. Walk should end on 0, or not far away from it.  | ![random_walk ](img/random_walk.png) |
| digits_frequency(rnd_seq)  | Shows and returns relative frequency of digits 0 and 1. Frequencies should be close to 0.5/0.5 | ![digits_frequency ](img/digits_frequency.png) |
